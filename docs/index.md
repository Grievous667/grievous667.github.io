## Basic Game Info

Shifting Stones is a game played on a $$ 3 \times 3 $$ grid of tiles. There are a total of 9 tiles, each belonging to one of four
tile types. Each tile has two faces, so there are a total of 8 possible faces that any given grid position could contain. The
breakdown of tiles is as follows:

- 1 tile with Sun/Moon faces
- 2 tiles with Fish/Bird faces
- 3 Tiles with Horse/Boat faces
- 3 Tiles with Tree/Seed faces

The objective of the game is to match patterns given on cards to the grid. Players start with four cards. The goal of the game is 
to arrange to game board in such a way that the board matches a pattern on a card in your hand. For example, a player might want to
arrange the grid so that a horse is directly above a boat. On a turn, a player can discard one or more of their cards to move a tile
either horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally). You get one move for each card you discard. Alternatively, a player can choose
to skip their turn to draw two more cards, but they cannot do this two turns in a row.
