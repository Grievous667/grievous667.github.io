# MRS: Shifting Stones Running Documentation 
## Overarching Objectives:
- Determine and implement an algorithm that finds an optimal set of moves to get the board to a given state.
- Determine and implement an algorithm that performs one turn optimal play.
- Determine the longest a game can run with optimal play (?).
